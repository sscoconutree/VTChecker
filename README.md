# VTChecker
Improved GUI-based VirusTotal bulk IP Address and Hash checker for non-premium API key users.

This is a GUI based VirusTotal bulk IP Address and Hash checker that was designed for non-premium VirusTotal API users.
Due to API key limitations of 4 requests/minute, there's a sleep timer in between the scans per hashes.
